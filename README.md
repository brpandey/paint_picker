# Paint Picker

### Description
Fun little web app that uses Elm and Phoenix to select paint can selections from the Phoenix backed Postgres 


Really impressed with Elm and the virtual DOM construction, separation of purity and impurity (handled by Elm runtime).
Happy that the Elm folks got rid of Signals / Mailboxes
